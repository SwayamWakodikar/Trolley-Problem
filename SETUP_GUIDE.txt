The application works on all modern browsers:
- Chrome (recommended)
- Firefox

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If the dev server doesn't start:
- Check if another process is using port 5173
- Try: npm run dev -- --port 3000 (use different port)

If dependencies fail to install:
- Delete node_modules folder and package-lock.json
- Run: npm install again

If animations are laggy:
- Check browser performance
- Try disabling browser extensions
- Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled

For styling issues:
- Clear browser cache
- Check if Tailwind CSS is properly configured
